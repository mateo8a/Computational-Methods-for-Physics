#Mathematica Projects

This repo consists of numerical simulations of a variety of physical systems. I've used algorithms such as Runge-Kutta 4 and the Fast Fourier Transform for each project. The Mathematica notebook in each folder is the file with extension .nb. 

##How to view the files

Mathematica uses the file extension .nb, which can only be opened with Wolfram-licensed software. For those of you who don't have Mathematica, you can use their CDF Player to open the .nb files. The CDF player can be downloaded for free [here](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/).
