#Mathematica Projects

This repo consists of numerical simulations of a variety of physical systems. I've used algorithms such as Runge-Kutta 4, the Fast Fourier Transform, and Lax-Wendroff for each project. For easy view, open the .wl file. The Mathematica notebook in each folder is the file with extension .nb. 

Each folder consists of my solutions to the problems given in the first edition book [*Computational Methods for Physics*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/computational-science-and-modelling/computational-methods-physics?format=HB) by Joel Franklin.

##How to open the Mathematica (.nb) files

Mathematica uses the file extension .nb, which can only be opened with Wolfram-licensed software. For those of you who don't have Mathematica, you can use their CDF Player to open the .nb files. The CDF player can be downloaded for free [here](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/).
